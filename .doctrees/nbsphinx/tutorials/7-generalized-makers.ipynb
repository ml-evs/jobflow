    "# Writing generalized Makers\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a generalized maker (ex. a defect maker that works for all supported DFT codes) is difficult since the general functionalities built around DFT code (VASP, CP2K, etc.) can differ significantly. Ideally you don't want to write completely independent `Makers` for each supported DFT code from scratch since much of the logic will be shared between these builders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have a sufficiently complex workflow made up of many job, the logic in each job will usually be mostly DFT-code-independent with a few crucial steps that are specific to each code. An example will be reading the structure form an exiting directory which requires the code-specific parsing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disentangling the DFT-code-dependent and independent parts can be a massive headache.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such we recommend the the following approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a base `Maker` object that defines the DFT-code-independent `Flow` in its `make` function. Code\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The specific `job`s invoked by the common `Maker` will accept `Callable` parameters for each code-specific operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The code-specific operations will be defined as abstract functions in the base `Maker`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each code-specific operation should be implemented in the child `Maker` which will be concrete implementations of the base `Maker`.\n"
